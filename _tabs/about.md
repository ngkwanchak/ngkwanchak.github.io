Hi, I’m Stephen — a Hongkonger who moved to Canada in 2022. This blog is where I share my journey of starting a new life abroad, the challenges I’ve faced, and the personal lessons I’ve learned along the way.

Relocating across continents isn’t just about geography — it’s about rebuilding from the ground up. Over the past few years, I’ve navigated cultural shifts, career transitions, and the quiet moments of self-reflection that come with starting over. Each experience has taught me something — sometimes the hard way — and I hope that by sharing these lessons, I can offer something useful to those on a similar path.

Alongside personal reflections, you’ll also find tech tips and tutorials here. As someone who works with technology, I enjoy breaking down complex tools into practical advice that others can use — whether it’s solving a problem, setting something up, or just learning something new.

Thanks for stopping by. Whether you’re here for the stories, the lessons, or the tech — I’m glad you’re here.
