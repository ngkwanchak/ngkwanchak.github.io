Setting up a new Linux development machine doesn't have to be painful. Here's a quick list of what I typically do:

1. Update packages: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`
2. Install essentials: `git`, `curl`, `vim`, `zsh`, `htop`
3. Set up SSH keys for GitHub
4. Clone dotfiles
5. Install Docker and VSCode

This post is a placeholder for a more detailed guide I’ll write later. Stay tuned!

> Tip: Automate this with a Bash script for even faster setup.
