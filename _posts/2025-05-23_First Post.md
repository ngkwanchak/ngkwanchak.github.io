Moving from Hong Kong to Canada in 2022 was one of the most defining decisions of my life. It wasnâ€™t just a change of address â€” it was a full reset on career, lifestyle, and mindset.

In this post, Iâ€™m sharing some lessons Iâ€™ve learned in my first year abroad, and some tech tools that helped me stay grounded and productive.

## ðŸ’¡ Final Thought: You Donâ€™t Need All the Answers

When I landed in Canada, I didnâ€™t have everything figured out â€” still donâ€™t. And thatâ€™s okay. You donâ€™t need all the answers to take the next step. You just need to keep walking.
